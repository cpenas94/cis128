        <p>Hello, my name is Henry and this is my first semester at College of San Mateo. I was previously studying Administration of Justice at Skyline College but I decided to change my major to Computer Science. Prior to attending classes within the San Mateo County College District, I spent a year traveling across the world primarily in Europe, Asia and Australia after ending my time in service with the United States Marine Corps.</p>

        <p>I've had an interest in web development for some time now and I had no idea where to start. I've watched YouTube videos where developers broke into the tech field through a few different pathways such as a Computer Science degree, a coding bootcamp or self study from the abundance of information on the internet. I started learning how to code through online sources such as The Odin Project and FreeCodeCamp but I felt lost throughout the process. I realized that I needed a more structured curriculum so I enrolled in a coding boot camp and decided to take this this course.   </p>
